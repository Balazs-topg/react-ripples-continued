# React Ripples Continued

React Ripples Continued is a React component library providing a visual ripple effect, typically used for button click or touch feedback. It's inspired by material design principles and now includes the RippleSurface component for more versatile usage.

Installation
Copy code
npm install react-ripples-continued
Usage
Ripples Component
The Ripples component creates a ripple effect. Note that the parent container should have overflow: "hidden" and position: "relative" for proper functionality.

```javascript
import { Ripples } from "react-ripples-continued";

export default function Button() {
  return (
    <button
      style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "relative" /* other styles */ }}
    >
      react ripples üéâ
      <Ripples />
    </button>
  );
}
```

RippleSurface Component
The RippleSurface component is a wrapper that simplifies implementing the ripple effect on various elements.

```javascript
import { RippleSurface } from "react-ripples-continued";

export default function CustomComponent() {
  return (
    <RippleSurface
      tag="div"
      rippleProps={
        {
          /* Ripple props */
        }
      }
    >
      {/* Your content */}
    </RippleSurface>
  );
}
```

## Props

### Ripples Component

All props are optional

#### `on`

- Type: `"click" | "mouseDown" | "clickAndMouseDown" | "hover"`
- Default: `"click"`

Determines the event that triggers the ripple effect.

#### `color`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `"white"`

Sets the color of the ripple effect.

#### `opacity`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `1`

Sets the opacity of the ripple effect. Accepts values between `0` (completely transparent) and `1` (completely opaque).

#### `blur`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `0`

Sets the blur amount for the ripple effect. The value is in `rem` units.

#### `duration`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `500`

Determines the duration of the ripple animation in milliseconds.

#### `fillAndHold`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

When set to `true`, the ripple effect will fill the container and hold its position until a mouse up event occurs.

#### `optimize`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

When set to `true`, the ripple elements will be removed from the DOM after the animation completes. This can be useful for performance optimization in scenarios with frequent ripple triggers, but it's set to false by default, since it can introduce some wierd behaviour.

#### `rippleElement`

- Type: `React.ReactNode`
- Default: `undefined`

When handed JSX it will display that JSX inside the ripple. Keep in mind that you probably want to lower the opacticy of the color prop or set `color=""` if you use `rippleElement`

The `rippleElement` prop can be used to do create some pretty cool stuff!

#### `zIndex`

- Type: `number`
- Default: `undefined`

### RippleSurface Component

All props are optional

#### `tag`

- Type: `React.ReactNode`
- Default: `HtmlTagName`

#### `children`

- Type: `React.ReactNode`
- Default: `ReactNode`

#### `disableDefaultStyling`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

When set to true, default styling (overflow and position) is not applied.

#### `rippleFromBehind`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

When set to true, the ripple effect appears behind the content.
Note: this will also wrap the "children" in a div

#### `forwardedRef`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `any`

Will forward the red

#### `onClick`, `onSubmit`, `onInput`

Event handlers

#### `rippleProps`

- Type: `RipplesInterface`

Props to be passed to the Ripples component.

## Internal Workings

### `addRipple`

This internal function is responsible for creating and animating the ripple effect based on the provided parameters.

This function is not react specific (except ReactDOM.createRoot for prasing JSX/createElement calls to js DOM operations), so it could quite easily be adpated for use with solid, vue, svelte, angular, or any other framework.

## Dynamic Animations

The component includes two animation keyframes:

1. `ripple-animation`: The standard ripple effect animation.
2. `ripple-fill-and-hold-scale-animation`: A fill and hold animation for the ripple effect.

## Styling

The ripple effect is styled with an absolute position, ensuring it covers its parent element. The size and position of the ripple are determined based on the triggering event's location.

Keep in mind that the parent element will need to be set to overflow: "hidden" and position: "relative"
